### Strategic Recommendations
- Cartesi could benefit from creating educational materials and offering mentoring sessions for developers at all levels, with a special emphasis on beginners and those not familiar with Cartesi.
- Organizing workshops and competitions focused on DeFi and infrastructure can help Cartesi engage more deeply with the developer community showing interest in these areas.
- The balanced presence of participants at the ETH Global hackathon provides an ideal platform for Cartesi to present specific challenges and prizes that can encourage adoption and innovation using their technology.
